Managing account passwords
===========================

Due to spam filtering or other issues, a small subsection of users might have an issue using the password reset function.
Follow the steps below to manually set a password for their account.

Prerequisites
--------------

Ensure the account you're using has the "Staff" permission to be able to access the admin area. (Not the backend, the admin area).
In case you're not sure if your account has the "Staff" status, please check with your system administrator.

Assigning a password to an account
-----------------------------------

#. Sign in to Costasiella's admin page at <your-costasiella-address>/d/admin. eg. https://example.costasiella.com/d/admin
#. Navigate to accounts in the menu on the left.
#. Use the search box in the top of the page to search for the email address of the account you want to set a password for or find it in the list.
#. In the password field look for the very small text "Raw passwords are not stored, so there is no way to see this userâ€™s password, but you can change the password using this form."
#. Click the "This form" link.
#. Set the desired password twice.
#. Click the Change password button.
#. The chosen password is now assigned to the account.
#. For security reasions, sign out of the admin section as soon as you're done using it.

Done.
