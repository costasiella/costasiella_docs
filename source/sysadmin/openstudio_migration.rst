OpenStudio migration
=============================

This page contains a list of things to keep in mind when migrating from OpenStudio by importing OpenStudio data.


For customers
--------------

- In case the address changes, users should update their bookmarks.
- Passwords can't be imported. Users should follow the password reset procedure to set a password.
- In Costasiella the first page customers will see is the shop page. In OpenStudio this is the log in page.
- A user can view their account details under the "My account" link in the shop once signed in.

For system administrators & studio staff
------------------------------------------

- In case the hosting address has changed, any links to it have to be updated. Eg. on the studio's website.
- The OpenStudio import page contains a list of items that can't be imported. These have to be added manually.
