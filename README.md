# costasiella_docs

Costasiella documentation. 

At the moment there's not much here yet, but it will be added little by little over the next year.



## Building the docs

### Install tools

The commands below assume a working python3 environment

Install Sphinx and the theme.

```bash
sudo pip3 install sphinx sphinx-rtd-theme
```

Then we can build the docs by executing the following command in this directory

```bash
sphinx-build source build
```
